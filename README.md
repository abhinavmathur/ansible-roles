# ansible-roles
These are collection of roles which was written to provision an Ubuntu 16.04 server for deploying a Rails app.
The reason behind writing this custom ansible script was to provision a 16.04 Ubuntu server, which comes without python preinstalled,
a required programming language for ansible to run. Using this ansible script, one can provision a server without manually
SSHing to the server and installing python there.
